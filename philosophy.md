# Philosophy

## Why Lean?

This repository is intentionally minimal.  
It provides the essential building blocks for AI-powered staff agents—roles, workflows, templates, and handbooks—without imposing complex structure or specialization.

## Guiding Principles

- **Simplicity:** Lower barrier to entry for new users and contributors.
- **Extensibility:** Encourage teams to add custom roles, workflows, and documentation as needed.
- **Reusability:** Templates and examples serve as seeds for any department or project.

## How to Use

- Start with the base roles and templates.
- Extend with specialized files for your own staff, workflows, and handbooks.
- Share improvements and specialized versions to help others build their own teams.

## Comparison to Full-featured Systems

- This repo is a "starter kit"—easy to fork, understand, and personalize.
- For advanced use cases, see [AI-Staff-HQ](https://github.com/your-org/AI-Staff-HQ) for a comprehensive, specialized implementation.
