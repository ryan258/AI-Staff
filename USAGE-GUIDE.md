# Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the AI Staff HQ framework to build and manage your own AI workforce.

## Core Concepts

This project is not just a collection of prompts, but a system for creating persistent AI personas with defined roles and expertise. The key is to think of your AI staff as a team of specialists who can collaborate and learn over time.

## Getting Started

1.  **Define Your Needs:** What tasks do you want to automate or augment with AI? What kind of specialists do you need?
2.  **Create Your Staff:** Start by creating a few AI staff members in the `staff/` directory. Give each one a clear role and a descriptive file name.
3.  **Develop Handbooks:** As you use your AI staff, you'll develop best practices and instructions. Document these in the `handbooks/` directory to ensure consistency.
4.  **Build Workflows:** For multi-step tasks, create workflows in the `workflows/` directory. This will help your AI staff collaborate and follow complex processes.
5.  **Use Templates:** Create reusable templates in the `templates/` directory for common tasks like writing blog posts or creating project briefs.

## How to Add New Content

### Adding New Staff

To create a new AI staff member, add a new Markdown file in the `staff/` directory. For example, `staff/my-new-assistant.md`. In that file, you can define the persona, capabilities, and instructions for that AI.

Here's a basic template:

```markdown
# [Staff Member Name]

## Role

A brief description of the staff member's role and responsibilities.

## Capabilities

-   A list of the staff member's skills and areas of expertise.

## Instructions

-   Specific instructions on how to interact with this staff member.
-   Examples of good and bad prompts.
```

### Adding New Handbooks

To add a new handbook, create a new Markdown file in the `handbooks/` directory. For example, `handbooks/my-new-handbook.md`.

### Adding New Templates

To add a new template, create a new file in the `templates/` directory. For example, `templates/my-new-template.md`.

### Adding New Workflows

To add a new workflow, create a new Markdown file in the `workflows/` directory. For example, `workflows/my-new-workflow.md`.

## Collaboration

The real power of this framework comes from collaboration. You can instruct your AI staff to work together on complex tasks. For example, you could have a "writer" AI and an "editor" AI collaborate on a blog post.

## Customization

This framework is highly customizable. You can add new directories, change the structure, and create your own unique AI workforce. The goal is to create a system that works for you.
