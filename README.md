# AI Staff HQ

This is a lean, extensible framework for building and managing your own AI workforce.

## Getting Started

This project provides a basic structure for organizing your AI assistants, handbooks, and workflows. You can customize it to fit your specific needs by adding your own content.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure is as follows:

```
.
├── handbooks/
│   └── README.md
├── staff/
│   └── README.md
├── templates/
│   └── README.md
├── workflows/
│   └── README.md
├── knowledge-base/
├── voices/
├── meta/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── USAGE-GUIDE.md
```

- **`handbooks/`**: Contains instructional materials and guides for your AI staff.
- **`staff/`**:  This is where you define your individual AI staff members. Each file in this directory can represent a different AI persona.
- **`templates/`**: Holds reusable templates for various tasks, such as project briefs or content creation.
- **`workflows/`**:  Contains multi-step processes and proven patterns for your AI staff to follow.
- **`knowledge-base/`**: A place for core principles, frameworks, and reference materials.
- **`voices/`**:  Defines different voice and tone guides for consistent communication.
- **`meta/`**:  Contains project metadata, changelogs, and version history.

## How to Add Your Own Content

This project is designed for you to bring your own staff, workflows, templates, and handbooks.

### Adding New Staff

To create a new AI staff member, add a new Markdown file in the `staff/` directory. For example, `staff/my-new-assistant.md`.  In that file, you can define the persona, capabilities, and instructions for that AI.

### Adding New Handbooks

To add a new handbook, create a new Markdown file in the `handbooks/` directory. For example, `handbooks/my-new-handbook.md`.

### Adding New Templates

To add a new template, create a new file in the `templates/` directory. For example, `templates/my-new-template.md`.

### Adding New Workflows

To add a new workflow, create a new Markdown file in the `workflows/` directory. For example, `workflows/my-new-workflow.md`.
