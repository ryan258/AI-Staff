# AI-Staff

## Overview

AI-Staff is a lean, extensible framework for building and managing AI-powered staff agents.  
It provides the essential files, templates, and examples to help you create your own customized team of AI agents for any project or department.

## Philosophy

This repository is intentionally minimal.

- **Easy to onboard:** New users and contributors can quickly understand and extend the core concepts.
- **Modular:** Add specialized roles, workflows, and templates as your needs grow.
- **Starter kit:** Use as a base for your own "department" or full-featured system.

For a comprehensive version with specialized staff, workflows, and documentation, see [AI-Staff-HQ](https://github.com/your-org/AI-Staff-HQ).
